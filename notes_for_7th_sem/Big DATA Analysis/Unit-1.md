## Big Data

### Definition
Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that cannot be efficiently processed, stored, or analyzed using traditional data management tools. It includes not only the size but also the complexity, variety, and velocity at which data is generated.

### Characteristics (the 5 V's)
- **Volume**: Refers to the massive amounts of data generated from various sources like social media, sensors, devices, applications, and more.
- **Velocity**: The speed at which new data is generated and needs to be processed (e.g., real-time data from IoT devices, financial transactions).
- **Variety**: The diversity of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (e.g., videos, images, text, audio).
- **Veracity**: The quality and accuracy of data, as data from different sources may be incomplete, inconsistent, or inaccurate.
- **Value**: The potential insights that can be gained from data analysis, leading to informed decisions, cost savings, and new business opportunities.

### Applications of Big Data
- **Healthcare**: Predicting disease outbreaks, personalized medicine, and improving patient care.
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking.
- **Retail**: Customer behavior analysis, product recommendations, and supply chain management.
- **Social Media and Marketing**: Targeted advertising, sentiment analysis, and brand monitoring.

## Hadoop

### Definition
Hadoop is an open-source framework created by the Apache Software Foundation for distributed storage and processing of large datasets. Hadoop is specifically designed to handle Big Data by allowing data to be processed in parallel across clusters of computers.

### Core Components
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: A file system that stores large datasets across multiple machines in a cluster. HDFS is highly fault-tolerant and can recover data from failures, making it reliable for storing Big Data.
- **MapReduce**: A programming model used for processing and generating large data sets in parallel by dividing tasks into two stages:
  - **Map**: Processes input data, filters it, and transforms it into key-value pairs.
  - **Reduce**: Aggregates and combines the output from the Map stage to produce a final result.
- **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: Manages and allocates resources across Hadoop clusters, improving system utilization and allowing for multiple applications to run simultaneously.
- **Hadoop Common**: A collection of common utilities and libraries that support other Hadoop components, helping the system work effectively.

### Hadoop Ecosystem
A set of tools and technologies designed to enhance Hadoop's functionality and usability:
- **Hive**: Data warehouse software that allows users to write SQL-like queries.
- **Pig**: A high-level scripting language for processing large datasets.
- **HBase**: A NoSQL database for real-time processing of large datasets.
- **Sqoop**: Facilitates the transfer of data between Hadoop and relational databases.
- **Flume**: A tool for collecting, aggregating, and moving large data volumes.

### Advantages of Hadoop
- **Scalability**: Can handle both small and large datasets, easily scaled by adding more nodes to the cluster.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Uses commodity hardware, which reduces infrastructure costs.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Can replicate data across multiple nodes, providing high availability and reliability.
- **Flexibility**: Capable of handling both structured and unstructured data.

### 1. **Types of Digital Data**
   - **Structured Data**: Data that is organized in a fixed format, like relational databases, spreadsheets, etc. It is easy to store, query, and analyze using standard SQL-based tools.
   - **Semi-Structured Data**: Data that doesn't reside in a traditional database but still has some structure, such as XML and JSON files. It includes tags or markers to separate data elements.
   - **Unstructured Data**: Data without a predefined data model, like emails, social media posts, audio, video, and text documents. Analyzing unstructured data requires specialized tools.

### 2. **Introduction to Big Data**
   - **Definition**: Big Data refers to vast volumes of data that are too complex and large for traditional data-processing software. It is characterized by the **3 V’s**: **Volume** (large amounts of data), **Velocity** (fast data processing), and **Variety** (different forms of data).
   - **Importance**: Big Data helps organizations make data-driven decisions, uncover hidden patterns, understand customer preferences, and enhance operational efficiency.

### 3. **Big Data Analytics**
   - **Purpose**: Analyzing Big Data to extract meaningful insights, patterns, and trends that can inform business decisions.
   - **Types of Analytics**:
      - **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarizes past data.
      - **Predictive Analytics**: Uses past data to make future predictions.
      - **Prescriptive Analytics**: Recommends actions based on predictions.
   - **Applications**: Used in sectors like finance (fraud detection), healthcare (predicting disease outbreaks), retail (personalized marketing), and more.

### 4. **History of Hadoop**
   - **Origins**: Developed in the early 2000s as a solution to manage large-scale data processing. Inspired by Google’s File System (GFS) and MapReduce framework.
   - **Founders**: Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella created Hadoop while working on the Apache Nutch project.
   - **Evolution**: Hadoop became an Apache project in 2008, providing a reliable and scalable framework for processing large datasets.


### 5. **Apache Hadoop**
   - **Overview**: An open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.
   - **Core Components**:
      - **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: Stores data across a distributed network, designed to handle large files.
      - **MapReduce**: A programming model for distributed data processing, where tasks are divided into two phases: Map (data filtering and sorting) and Reduce (aggregating results).
   - **Key Benefits**: Scalability, fault tolerance, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.

### 6. **Analyzing Data with Unix Tools**
   - **Purpose**: Unix command-line tools like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `sort`, and `cut` can perform basic data manipulation tasks on text files.
   - **Benefits**: Useful for quick data exploration, filtering, and sorting when working with smaller datasets before moving to more complex processing tools like Hadoop.

### 7. **Analyzing Data with Hadoop**
   - **Purpose**: Hadoop provides a scalable and efficient way to analyze vast datasets. By leveraging the MapReduce framework, data can be processed across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster.
