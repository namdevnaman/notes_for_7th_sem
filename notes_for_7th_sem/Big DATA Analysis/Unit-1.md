## Hadoop

### Definition
Hadoop is an open-source framework created by the Apache Software Foundation for distributed storage and processing of large datasets. Hadoop is specifically designed to handle Big Data by allowing data to be processed in parallel across clusters of computers.

### Core Components
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: A file system that stores large datasets across multiple machines in a cluster. HDFS is highly fault-tolerant and can recover data from failures, making it reliable for storing Big Data.
- **MapReduce**: A programming model used for processing and generating large data sets in parallel by dividing tasks into two stages:
  - **Map**: Processes input data, filters it, and transforms it into key-value pairs.
  - **Reduce**: Aggregates and combines the output from the Map stage to produce a final result.
- **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: Manages and allocates resources across Hadoop clusters, improving system utilization and allowing for multiple applications to run simultaneously.
- **Hadoop Common**: A collection of common utilities and libraries that support other Hadoop components, helping the system work effectively.

### Hadoop Ecosystem
A set of tools and technologies designed to enhance Hadoop's functionality and usability:
- **Hive**: Data warehouse software that allows users to write SQL-like queries.
- **Pig**: A high-level scripting language for processing large datasets.
- **HBase**: A NoSQL database for real-time processing of large datasets.
- **Sqoop**: Facilitates the transfer of data between Hadoop and relational databases.
- **Flume**: A tool for collecting, aggregating, and moving large data volumes.

### Advantages of Hadoop
