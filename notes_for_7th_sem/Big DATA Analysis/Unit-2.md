# HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)

### Overview of HDFS
   - **Purpose**: HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications. It is designed to store and manage large datasets across multiple machines in a distributed environment, making it scalable and resilient.
   - **Core Design**:
      - **Distributed Storage**: HDFS splits large files into blocks and distributes them across a network of nodes.
      - **Fault Tolerance**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring availability even if some nodes fail.

### Key Components of HDFS
   - **NameNode**:
      - **Role**: Acts as the master node that manages the filesystem metadata (file permissions, directory structure, and locations of data blocks).
      - **Responsibilities**: Tracks the locations of blocks, manages file permissions, and coordinates access.
      - **Importance**: The NameNode is critical, as it directs client requests to the appropriate DataNodes, although it does not directly store the data itself.
   - **DataNodes**:
      - **Role**: Worker nodes that store the actual data blocks in HDFS.
      - **Responsibilities**: Perform read and write operations as instructed by the NameNode. DataNodes also report their block status and health to the NameNode regularly.
      - **Fault Tolerance**: DataNodes replicate data blocks according to the replication factor, ensuring data reliability.
   - **Secondary NameNode**:
      - **Purpose**: Serves as a backup to the NameNode by periodically saving snapshots of the filesystem metadata. This process allows for faster recovery but does not act as a true failover NameNode.

### HDFS Data Storage
   - **Blocks**:
      - **Definition**: HDFS splits files into large blocks (typically 128MB or 256MB).
      - **Benefits**: Large block sizes reduce the amount of metadata the NameNode needs to manage, and allow for efficient streaming data reads.
      - **Replication**: Each block is replicated across multiple DataNodes based on the replication factor (default is 3).
   - **Data Read and Write Process**:
      - **Writing Data**: The client requests file creation from the NameNode. The NameNode designates the DataNodes for storing each block, and the client writes each block to the designated DataNodes.
      - **Reading Data**: The client requests data from the NameNode, which provides the block locations on DataNodes. The client then reads data directly from the DataNodes.

### Advantages of HDFS
   - **Fault Tolerance**: Data is replicated across nodes, ensuring no data loss in case of hardware failure.
   - **Scalability**: Can handle petabytes of data by adding more nodes.
   - **High Throughput**: Designed for high data throughput, making it suitable for batch processing.

### Limitations of HDFS
   - **Small File Handling**: HDFS is inefficient for handling large numbers of small files, as it increases NameNode memory usage.
   - **Low-Latency Data Access**: HDFS is not optimized for low-latency, real-time data access. It's best suited for sequential data access.

# The Design of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)

### Overview of HDFS
   - **Purpose**: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is designed to reliably store large datasets across multiple machines in a distributed environment. Its architecture is highly fault-tolerant and supports the storage and analysis of vast data volumes.
   - **Inspiration**: HDFS was inspired by the Google File System (GFS) and aims to address the need for scalable, efficient data storage for large datasets in Big Data applications.

### Core Characteristics of HDFS Design
   - **Large Block Size**: HDFS stores files in large blocks, typically 128MB or 256MB, as opposed to the smaller block sizes used in traditional file systems. This minimizes the amount of metadata the NameNode needs to manage and improves data transfer rates.
   - **Distributed Storage**: Files are divided into blocks and stored across multiple nodes in the cluster, enabling distributed data processing and storage.
   - **Data Replication**: Each data block is replicated across several nodes (typically three by default) to ensure data reliability and availability even in the event of hardware failure.
   - **Write-Once, Read-Many**: HDFS is optimized for applications that require large-scale, sequential reads and writes. Once written, data is not modified but read multiple times.

### Key Components of HDFS

1. **NameNode**:
   - **Role**: The master server that manages the metadata of the file system (file names, permissions, hierarchy, block locations, etc.).
   - **Responsibilities**: Tracks the location of data blocks across DataNodes, manages file system namespace, and handles client requests for file access.
   - **Single Point of Failure**: If the NameNode goes down, the system loses access to the entire file system. To address this, some HDFS installations use a secondary or backup NameNode.

2. **DataNodes**:
   - **Role**: Worker nodes that actually store data blocks in the HDFS.
   - **Responsibilities**: Perform read and write operations on behalf of the client, and periodically report their status and the list of stored blocks to the NameNode.
   - **Block Replication**: Each block is stored on multiple DataNodes according to the replication factor, allowing HDFS to tolerate node failures.

3. **Secondary NameNode**:
   - **Purpose**: Although it is not a backup of the NameNode, it performs periodic checkpoints of the file system metadata to prevent data loss.
   - **Functionality**: Combines the edit logs and the current file system state to create a new checkpoint, which helps the NameNode recover more quickly in case of failure.

### HDFS Data Storage Mechanism
   - **Data Block Division**: Large files are split into smaller blocks, typically 128MB or larger, to facilitate efficient storage and management. The blocks are stored independently across different DataNodes.
   - **Replication Factor**: Each block is replicated (by default, 3 times) across different nodes, providing redundancy. If one DataNode fails, other replicas ensure data availability.
   - **Fault Tolerance**: HDFS is designed to handle failures gracefully. In the event of a node failure, HDFS automatically re-replicates blocks to maintain the desired replication factor.

### Data Access in HDFS
   - **Write Operation**:
      - The client contacts the NameNode to create a file. The NameNode determines the location of DataNodes where blocks will be stored.
      - Data is split into blocks, and each block is written to the first DataNode, which then replicates it to two other nodes.
      - Once the data is written and replicated, the client receives an acknowledgment.
   - **Read Operation**:
      - The client requests a file from the NameNode, which responds with the locations of the data blocks on various DataNodes.
      - The client reads the data directly from the DataNodes, bypassing the NameNode for actual data transfer, which allows for faster and more efficient data retrieval.

### Advantages of HDFS Design
   - **Scalability**: HDFS can handle petabytes of data by adding more nodes, making it suitable for growing data storage needs.
   - **Fault Tolerance**: Data replication ensures reliability. HDFS automatically detects and recovers from node failures, protecting against data loss.
   - **High Throughput**: Large block sizes and the ability to process data in parallel across nodes make HDFS highly efficient for batch processing.

### Limitations of HDFS Design
   - **Inefficiency with Small Files**: HDFS is optimized for large files, so handling a large number of small files can burden the NameNode with excessive metadata.
   - **Limited Real-Time Access**: HDFS is not ideal for applications requiring low-latency data access or real-time data processing.
   - **Write-Once, Read-Many Model**: HDFS does not support modifying data after it has been written, which can limit its use in applications that require frequent updates.

### Data Flow in HDFS
   - **Data Write Process**:
      1. The client contacts the NameNode to initiate file creation.
      2. The NameNode selects DataNodes to store each block based on factors like available storage and network proximity.
      3. The client writes data to the first DataNode, which forwards it to the second and third DataNodes for replication.
      4. Once all replicas are confirmed, the client receives an acknowledgment of successful data write.
   - **Data Read Process**:
      1. The client requests a file from the NameNode, which provides the list of DataNodes containing the requested data blocks.
      2. The client reads data directly from the nearest DataNodes, which optimizes bandwidth usage and improves performance.

## 2. HDFS Concepts
   - **Blocks**: Data in HDFS is divided into large blocks, generally 128MB or larger. This block-based structure simplifies storage management and enables HDFS to handle very large files efficiently.
   - **Replication**: Each block of data is replicated across multiple DataNodes to ensure high availability and reliability in the event of hardware failures.
   - **NameNode and DataNode**:
      - **NameNode**: Acts as the master node, managing the file system metadata (file structure, permissions, and locations of data blocks).
      - **DataNodes**: Store the actual data blocks. They communicate with the NameNode and perform tasks as directed by it.
   - **Secondary NameNode**: A checkpoint node that takes periodic snapshots of the NameNode metadata to assist with data recovery.

## 3. Command Line Interface (CLI)
   - **Purpose**: Hadoop’s CLI enables users to interact with HDFS for various tasks like file management, system monitoring, and administration.
   - **Important Commands**:
      - **File Management**:
         - `hdfs dfs -ls /`: Lists files and directories in the specified HDFS path.
         - `hdfs dfs -put localfile /hdfs/path`: Uploads a local file to HDFS.
         - `hdfs dfs -get /hdfs/path localfile`: Downloads an HDFS file to the local file system.
         - `hdfs dfs -rm /path/to/file`: Deletes a specified file in HDFS.
      - **Directory Management**:
         - `hdfs dfs -mkdir /new_directory`: Creates a new directory in HDFS.
         - `hdfs dfs -rmdir /empty_directory`: Deletes an empty directory in HDFS.
   - **Utility**: The CLI is a powerful tool for developers and administrators to perform quick, efficient operations within HDFS.

## 4. Hadoop File System Interfaces
   - **FS Shell**: A command-line tool provided by Hadoop that allows users to manage HDFS files. Commands include file manipulation, setting permissions, and checking storage status.
   - **Web UI**: HDFS provides a web-based interface for administrators and users to monitor the system's health, check file locations, and manage file permissions.
   - **APIs**:
      - **Java API**: Hadoop offers APIs that allow developers to write Java programs for interacting with HDFS. These APIs support file operations like reading, writing, deleting, and permission management.
      - **REST API**: A RESTful service available for applications outside the Hadoop ecosystem, allowing HTTP-based interactions with HDFS.

## 5. Data Flow in HDFS
   - **Write Data Flow**:
      - Data is split into blocks and written across DataNodes. The client connects to the NameNode to request file creation, then receives a list of DataNodes where each block will be stored.
      - The client writes each block to the first DataNode, which then replicates it to the second, and so forth until the replication factor is met.
   - **Read Data Flow**:
      - The client connects to the NameNode to get metadata about the file. It retrieves block locations from the DataNodes and reads data directly from them.
      - **Fault Tolerance**: If a DataNode becomes unavailable, HDFS uses other replicas to ensure data is accessible without interruption.

## 6. Data Ingest with Flume and Sqoop

### Overview of Data Ingestion
   - **Purpose**: Data ingestion refers to the process of moving data from various sources into Hadoop. The data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured and may come from sources like databases, log files, social media, sensors, and more.
   - **Challenges**: Data ingestion in Big Data involves handling data at high volume and velocity, requiring efficient tools that can process and load data into HDFS for analysis.

### Apache Flume
   - **Definition**: Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available tool for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data into HDFS.
   - **Architecture**:
      - **Source**: Receives data from external sources like web servers, applications, or log files.
      - **Channel**: Acts as a buffer that stores events until they are consumed by the sink.
      - **Sink**: Delivers data from the channel to the destination, which could be HDFS, HBase, or another system.
   - **Data Flow in Flume**:
      - **1. Event Creation**: Data (logs, metrics, etc.) is generated by sources (e.g., application logs).
      - **2. Transfer to Flume Agent**: Data flows into Flume via a source agent, which collects events and places them in a channel.
      - **3. Sink Writes Data to HDFS**: The channel forwards the events to the sink, which writes data to HDFS.
   - **Benefits of Flume**:
      - **Real-Time Data Collection**: Flume can capture log data in real time and move it into HDFS.
      - **Reliability**: Provides data durability by using a channel buffer in case of temporary failure in the data pipeline.
      - **Scalability**: Multiple Flume agents can be deployed across servers, allowing it to handle high-velocity data ingestion.

### Apache Sqoop
   - **Definition**: Sqoop is a command-line tool designed to transfer data between Hadoop and relational databases (such as MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server).
   - **Use Cases**:
      - **Data Import**: Sqoop can import data from traditional databases into HDFS, Hive, or HBase.
      - **Data Export**: Sqoop can export processed data from HDFS back to relational databases.
   - **Architecture and Working**:

## 7. Hadoop Archives
   - **Purpose**: Hadoop Archives (HAR) reduce the number of files in HDFS by bundling smaller files into a larger, single archive. This minimizes NameNode memory usage, which can be heavily taxed by numerous small files.
   - **Command**: `hadoop archive -archiveName <archive_name> -p <input_path> <output_path>`
      - **Example**: To create an archive named `data.har` for all files in `/input_directory` and save it in `/output_directory`, the command would be:
        ```
        hadoop archive -archiveName data.har -p /input_directory /output_directory
        ```

## 8. Hadoop I/O: Compression, Serialization, Avro, and File-Based Data Structures
   - **Compression**:
      - **Purpose**: Compression reduces storage requirements and speeds up data transfer.
      - **Common Formats**: `gzip`, `bzip2`, `Snappy`, and `LZO`.
      - **Usage**: Compressed files help optimize network usage and improve job processing efficiency.
   - **Serialization**:
      - **Definition**: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
      - **Writable Interface**: Hadoop uses the Writable interface for serialization, making it efficient for network transmission and storage.
   - **Avro**:
      - **Overview**: A row-based serialization framework that supports rich data structures, schema evolution, and remote procedure calls (RPC).
      - **Use Cases**: Avro is ideal for serializing data for Hadoop storage and enabling data exchange between different systems.
